# team-projects-find-space

Overview: Find Space is an interactive 3D space survival game built using Three.js. In this project, players navigate a dynamic, immersive space environment, piloting a custom-designed spaceship through various challenges. The game features spatial exploration, real-time camera switching (e.g., cockpit and third-person views), interactive lighting systems like togglable spotlights and suns, and animated physics-driven movement including tilt-based spaceship control. Additional features include textured objects, environmental elements (like nebuala dust), user-triggered animations, and keyboard-based navigation. The goal of the project is to combine creative modeling with technical Three.js functionality to produce an engaging and visually rich experience for everyone.
